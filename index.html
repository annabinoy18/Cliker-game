            <h3>ABOUT THE GAME</h3>
            <p>RED-GREEN-YELLOW is a fun and engaging color-clicking game that challenges your reaction time and coordination. In this game, players interact with three color-coded buttons: red, green, and yellow. The objective is simple: click each button as many times as possible before the timer runs out.</p>

            <h4>HOW TO PLAY</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Click the Buttons: Each button represents a different color and counts the number of times it has been clicked. Click on the red, green, and yellow buttons to increase your score for each color.</li>
                <li>Score Tracking: Your score is tracked in real-time and displayed next to each button, allowing you to see how many times youâ€™ve clicked each color.</li>
                <li>Timer: A countdown timer starts at 15 seconds. Keep an eye on the timer to ensure you maximize your clicks before time runs out.</li>
                <li>Restart: If you want to play again, hit the "Restart" button to reset the scores and timer. You can also return to the home page using the "Home" button.</li>
